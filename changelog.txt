1	During the intra prediction, some modes are skipped in RMD depending on the neighbor availability.
	If the upper-right PU is not available, the down-left directions (27-34) are skipped, if the bottom-left PU is not available, the upper-right directions (2-9) are skipped, and so on.

2	This procedure is applied to the entire frame

3	The MPM selection is left unchanged

4	The RDO evaluation is left unchanged

5	The remaining of the encoding is left unchanged

Fixed a bug where the vertical position of the CU was not calculated properly due to type mismatch.
Implemented the possibility to activate the reduced modes algorithm on the Polar or Central area of the frame independently.
	Uncomment line 2312 of TEncSearch.cpp to enable the algorithm on the central area, leave unchanged to activate in polar area.
