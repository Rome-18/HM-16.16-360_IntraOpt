The MPM selection is performed before the RMD.

Since the MPMs are appended in the end of the list generated by the RMD, the total number of modes which go to full RD is greater than the original version.

Original:	-PUs 64x64, 32x32, 16x16 could have 3:6 modes in the full rd list
	 	-PUs 8x8 and 4x4 could have 8:11 modes in the full rd list
This version:	-PUs 64x64, 32x32, 16x16 will have 6 modes in the full rd list
	 	-PUs 8x8 and 4x4 will have 11 modes in the full rd list
