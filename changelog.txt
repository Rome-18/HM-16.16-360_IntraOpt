During the selection of intra-prediction modes, the CU position is evaluated. If the CU is in the top or bottom 25% of the frame, the following algorithm is applied during the intra mode selection.

1 - Depending on the PU size, a different number of modes are evaluated during the RMD evaluation. There are 4 sets of modes avaliable for each PU size: 75%, 80%, 90%i and 90%u of accuracy. The 75%, 80% and 90%i represent the intersection of the most probable modes for the upper and lower band, whereas the 90%u represent the union of the 90% most probable modes for the upper and lower band. The numbers below represent the number of modesevaluated for each set.
    // 75% 80% 90%i 90%u
    // 4	5	12	15

2 - The number of modes which go to the RDO evaluation is left unchanged
3 - The MPM selection is left unchanged
4 - The remaining of the encoding is left unchanged
